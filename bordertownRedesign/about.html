            <h2>It started in an abandoned building</h2>
            <p>When we discovered the old Theta Chi fraternity, it had been abandoned over a year.  We put in several
              offers over several years only to have them turned down in favor of another plan.</p>

          <div class="slidingText">
            <h2>Slated for demolition. Saved by the HPC</h2>
            <p>Eventually the building was sold to a developer and prepared for demolition. We spent a year,
              wondering when they'd tear it down. Until, we received a letter from the Heritage Preservation
              Commission, stating the building was under historic consideration.</p>

            <h2>No Insurance = No Financing. A Cash gift.</h2>
            <p>We couldn't get insurance on our abandoned building.  So we couldn't get financing.  At the last
              moment a friend gave us 300K cash and we closed.</p>

        <h1>The Bordertown Name</h1>
        <p>
          The Bordertown name comes from a desire to reach beyond ourselves and describes a place where people from
          different backgrounds live and work together as friends.

          The vision for Bordertown started when one of our founders (in his college days) heard about starving children
          and realized he need to live for more than his own aspirations and entertainment.

          The photographs in our entry are from a home in the border-town Juarez, Mexico that serves children and families
          in one of the most violent cities in the world.  Chon and Juanis who run the home are committed to loving and
          serving the Las Flores neighborhood of Juarez.  The pictures are from an event for the home.
